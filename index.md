### Stripe
SMB Operations Specialist
As a specialist, I balanced solving the most complex and technical questions for our users, with managing projects and developing systems that would allow Stripe to scale support across new countries and products.

*Core*
* Was on average 140% to productivity target each week during 2020, and 135% to target
during 2021.
* As the sole Specialist in EMEA running the thrice weekly techincal recruitment interviews, I trained in 4 new hires remotely, all achieving well
beyond their targets by end of spin-up period.
* Created a SQL Education course for Operations specialists with non-technical backgrounds. #3 most visited internal
Operations document during 2021.
*Impact*
* Identified opportunities to outsource support cases to external vendors. Identified trends that lead to the reduction of ~20 cases per week, resulting in $50k cost savings per year.
* Improved tooling for one of our highest volume support requests; SEPA DD & ACH limit increase requests. This greatly reduced escalation rate, and significalty reduced cost to serve for an average support ticket.
* As EMEA Ops lead for the launch of Stripe Identity, I built out the operational resources required for launch.
*Company Building*
Assumed the role of Dublin Comms officer from January 2020—21. Handled internal migration away from Campaigner. Engaged in company building by spearheading a revamp of the Dublin Digest weekly newsletter. Put together said newsletter at a weekly cadence.
